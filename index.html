        <p>
            I came to the US in summer 2013 to study for a PhD degree in business. 
            Although I didn't get a PhD degree at the end, I'm grateful for the 4-year 
            self-discovery journey that I went through during my tenure as a PhD student. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The course load in the first two years was enough to keep me busy and away from 
            any other activities. Once I was done with courses, I had to study for the 
            qualifying exam. I discovered my inner-calligrapher during the 8-week 
            study-period leading up to the exam.
        </p>

            Here I share highlights of this journey. My Instagram portfolio came in 
            handy in building this page. Hope you enjoy!

                <p>
                    <b>May 2015</b> - I have been studying for two weeks. Graduation in over. 
                    School is quiet. Faculty are wrapping up and getting ready for summer break. 
                    First-years are already gone. Third-year and above are dealing with their 
                    more complicated life. <br>What is more interesting than studying? ANYTHING!

                    The struggle was real. So... things started coming out... slowly!

                    I found this soothing effect in using a pen for something other than proving theorems 
                    or grading undergraduate or MBA case studies and exams.
                </p>
                <p>Hmmm... What else can I do?</p>

                    <b>Fast forward: August 2015</b> - I passed the qualifying exam. Great! 
                    Now I have to work on a research paper. Exciting!!! Not really. But... I had more 
                    exciting things going on. I found this <a href="http://pilotpen.us/categories/calligraphy-pens/parallel-pen/">cool pen</a> 
                    and started playing around with it. It came with a short manual on different lettering 
                    styles.

                    I started following artists on Instagram. Also looking for inspiration. 
                    There is LOTS of them on Instagram. Here is another one that I tried:

                <h2>Mentor</h2>
                <p><b>September 2015</b> - While Instagram and Pinterest of full of inspiring 
                    content, self-teaching can be sometimes frustrating. Thanks to Google, 
                    I found the <a href = "http://stlcalligraphyguild.org">St. Louis Calligraphy Guild</a> and 
                    learned about local classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I signed up for the first available class and 
                    <a href="https://magazine.mst.edu/2018/03/lettering-for-a-living/">Cheryl Tefft</a> 
                    became my mentor. I studied with Cheryl for about 2 years. She is a hardworking 
                    and extremely talented artist. Hand-lettering is her full-time job and she's very good 
                    at it.

                <h2>Lettering</h2>
                <p>
                    I took several courses with Cheryl during the two years that she was my mentor. Here is a 
                    few lettering styles/techniques that I learned in her classes.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Uncial</li>
                    <li>Italic</li>
                    <li>Mastering Dip-pen</li>
                    <li>Copperplate Roundhand</li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h3>Uncial</h3>
                <p>Wikipedia says:</p>
                    <div class = "quotes">
                            Uncial is a majuscule script (written entirely in capital letters) 
                            commonly used from the 4th to 8th centuries AD by Latin and Greek scribes. 
                            Uncial letters were used to write Greek, Latin, and Gothic.
                        
                    </div>
                    
                <p>
                    Uncial is a strange lettering style. However, it is the base for more fancy 
                    lettering styles like "Italic". Here is my mono-line practice of a few alphabet 
                    sentences in Uncial, together with English alphabet written with Pilot parallel pen.

                <h3>Italic</h3>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, Uncial is the base for Italic lettering. 
                    Essentially, Italic is "Uncial written on a slant".

                <h3>Mastering Dip-Pen</h3>
                <p>
                    Before this course, I'd been using cartridge pens (like Pilot parallel pens)
                    in which ink is stored in a plastic container that feeds the nib. 
                    Now, it was time to grow up and use <b>real</b> ink. This is still limited to
                    broad nib (broad-edge) pens. Working with "Pointed-pen" is still a <i>dream</i> at this point.</p>
                <p>Here is a few extra challenges we had to face in this course:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Ink</b> - good ink for calligraphy needs to have a certain consistency. 
                        There are different types of ink in the market. Certain chemicals are used to help 
                        reach the ideal consistency. <a href="https://thepostmansknock.com/a-guide-to-calligraphy-inks/">This </a> 
                        is a good discussion on varieties of inks used for calligraphy. 
                    </li><br>
                        
                    <li><b>Nib</b> - different nibs are designed to get different jobs done. Choice of nib
                            sometimes depends on the paper. Some nibs have reservoirs and can hold more ink
                            so less 'loading' is required. Complicated stuff!
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p> 
                    Turns out, working with real ink is hard and it can be very messy! That's why paper towels are a calligrapher's best friend.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My Favorite <i>real</i> ink is <b>walnut</b> ink. It has a nice texture and you can choose
                    adjust the intensity to get your desired shade of brown. Of course I used walnut ink for my final project
                    of "mastering dip-pen" class.

                    <h3>Copperplate Roundhand</h3>
                    <p>
                        Learning to write in Copperplate is every beginner's dream. The long journey 
                        of mastering basics was worth it. Copperplate is magical but complicated and requires
                        lots and lots of practice. On top of the skills that we had mastered so far, we had to
                        learn how to work with an <b>oblique pen</b> and a <b>pointed nib</b>!
                    </p>

                        In every course, we had a "Single Quote" project that involved a clean finish of
                        a sentence or quote, using the techniques we learned in the courses. Extra challenges
                        are always fun. Writing on a circle is not hard, but can be tricky. I gave it a 
                        shot.
